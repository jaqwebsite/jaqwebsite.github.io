# REVIEW: I AM MUSIC - PLAYBOI CARTI
finally got around to writing some content lmao. fitting that its a carti review with how much i delayed this
DISCLAIMER: EVERYTHING DISCUSSED IN THIS REVIEW IS OBJECTIVELY 100%  TRUE FACTS
## TRACK REVIEWS
**POP OUT - 7.5/10**
metal af and has crazy energy this goes crazy in the right situation
it does kinda hurt my ears though
**CRUSH - 8.5/10**
instantly loved this song when carti first previewed it at rl miami. the beat goes so hard f1lthy and travis actually snapped. only thing that i think missed on this song is if travis had a proper feature instead of the lyrics being like 3/4 seeyuh. still hard though one of my favourites
**K POP (KETAMINE) - 8/10**
the vibe of this song is so hard. i kinda wish it was longer but itd prolly get boring if he didnt switch it up a bit so i think the length is fine
**EVIL J0RDAN - 9/10**
the lyrics of this song are so hard but the intro is way too long imo itd hit just as hard if it was like a quarter of the time. the gunshot is hard idc
**MOJO JOJO (ft kendrick) - 4/10**
kendrick is one of my goats but he sold this feature so much man
he had the opportunity to go crazy on a trap beat like he did on tHat part (ADD A LINK HERE), but instead hes relegated to this zesty ahh intro and stupid ad libs :broken_heart:
**PHILLY (ft travis) - 6.5/10**
beat and travis feature are decent but nun special
**RADAR - 9.5/10**
beat and vocals are both so hard i feel like the vocals fit with the beat so well
**RATHER LIE (ft the weeknd) - 10/10**
hearing carti properly sing is so crazy. weeknd verse is pretty good but nothing as special as carti's singing
**FINE SHIT - 7/10**
pretty good song, nothing that i think could be improved but its nothing that special
**BACKD00R (ft kendrick and jhene aiko) - 7/10**
this songs pretty decent. really vibey and kendricks feature is pretty good, reminds me of everything i love about mr morale and the big steppers.
**TOXIC (ft skepta) - 2/10**
ngl i hate cartis voice on this song. it took a long time for me to belive that it was carti and not future.
i love skepta but his verse was kinda terrible imo. idk if it was bad or it just matches the beat so badly but it did not hit
**MUNYUN - 6/10** 
the beats pretty hard but i feel like cartis vocals are kinda low energy
**CRANK - 8/10**
FREE THROAT :fire: :talking:
the beat and energy on this song is awesome
**CHARGE DEM HOES A FEE (ft future and travis) - 4/10**
im not really a big fan of future in the first place and his verse is repetitive af and kinda not hype at all ngl. cartis verse the same.
travis's verse is fire though i wish they let him have more time
**GOOD CREDIT (ft kendrick) - 4/10**
kendricks verse is kinda trash on this one too ngl. i feel like his lyrics were kinda good but the inflection just did not fit the song at all. cartis verse is alright
**I SEE YOU BABY BOI - 8/10**
one of the few examples of that snare roll that they kept spamming actually went kinda good (i think they updated the mixing now so the rolls arent that bad). great song
**WAKE UP F1LTHY (ft travis) - 9/10**
deep voice carti :fire:
travis's verse and the beat was so good aswell
**JUMPIN (ft lil uzi) - 7/10**
carti is kinda copying futures voice again on this one but its kinda good this time
so happy to see carti and lil uzi collabing again its fire wish this song was longer
**TRIM (ft future) - 7/10**
future went crazy on this 
**COCAINE NOSE - 10/10**
sample hard af
**WE NEED ALL DA VIBES (ft young thug and ty dolla sign) - 8/10**
thuggers parts are fire
cartis part too i love cartis different vocal styles through this album
**OLYMPIAN - 8/10**
reminds me of die lit
**OPM BABI - 10/10**
you wouldnt understand
**TWIN TRIM (by lil uzi) - 7/10**
i really like this song but its way too short
**LIKE WEEZY - 8/10**
**DIS 1 GOT IT - 1/10**
imma be real ion like this song at all its just another repetitive future copy that doesnt match the beat at all
maybe ill understand it eventually
**WALK - 4/10**
this one has a lot of the same things i dont like as dis 1 got it but its less bad this song is kinda hype
**H00DBYAIR - 10/10**
**HBA - 0/10**
get rid of the snare rolls bru
**OVERLY - 4/10**
same issues as dis 1 got it
vocals dont match the beat but at least its a bit more unique
**SOUTH ATLANTA BABY - 8/10**
pretty nice end to the album
only downside is that the production feels a little sloppily executed imo but its still nice to listen to
**DIFFERENT DAY - 10/10**
this song does atmospheric and vibeyness perfectly
**2024 - 8/10**
the beat is great kanye will always be the goat

**FOMDJ - 8/10**
beat is fire and cartis vocals are hype af
## OVERALL REVIEW - 7.5/10
i love the variety on this album but i wish it was arranged in a better way so that it felt more like an album instead of a mixtape from a bunch of random eras. ngl the randomness of the production and spammed dj tags and sound effects fit pretty well into the mixtape era vibe i think carti was going for which i dont think most people understood.
my biggest criticism of the album is how badly the songs are ordered on the album. idk how to describe it but it makes the album way nicer to listen to in order when at least some thought is put into the order, like wtf is the transition from cocaine nose to we need all da vibes.
i feel like it didnt need as many tracks and wouldve been better if it had less tracks, but made them longer and put more effort into the production.
overall i think he did pretty well for the concept of the album, its hard to get something that everyones goanna like with how experimental and how much variety is on the album. its hard to compare it with the rest of cartis albums since theyre so different but i definitely liked it a lot more than whole lotta red. die lit is better though i think
