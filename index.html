    <p>hello! welcome to my website :)<br>
      at the moment it doesn't serve much purpose besides just being somewhere for me to learn web design. i'm still
      developing a lot of the framework for what the website will eventually become, so some links might just lead to a
      placeholder and some things that are referenced may not exist yet. also, this website isnt very accesible on
      mobile at the moment, but everything should still be accessible.<br>
      in future, i want to have some guides on how to make some fun things and a blog of some things i find interesting.</p>
